      <h2>Infertility</h2>
      <p>
      Infertility is the inability to conceive after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse. It can affect both men and women and may be caused by hormonal imbalances, ovulation disorders, blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count, genetic factors, or lifestyle choices. Conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, and uterine abnormalities can also contribute to infertility in women.
      </p>
      <p>
      Advancements in medical technology offer various treatments, including medications, hormonal therapy, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans improve the chances of conception, helping couples achieve their dream of parenthood.
