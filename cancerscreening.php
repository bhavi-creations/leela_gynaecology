            <h2>Cancer Screening</h2>
           <p>
           Cancer screening involves medical tests to detect cancer at an early stage before symptoms appear.
            Early detection improves treatment success and survival rates. Screening recommendations vary based
             on age, gender, and risk factors.
 Common Cancer Screening Tests
 Breast Cancer Screening
Mammogram (X-ray of the breast): Recommended every 1â€“2 years for women aged 40+ (or earlier for high-risk individuals).
Clinical Breast Exam (CBE): Performed by a doctor to check for lumps or abnormalities.
Self-Breast Examination: Monthly self-check for lumps or changes.
Cervical Cancer Screening
Pap Smear: Detects abnormal cervical cells (recommended every 3 years for women 21-29 and every 5 years with HPV testing for 30-65).
HPV Test: Screens for high-risk human papillomavirus strains that can cause cervical cancer.
HPV Vaccine: Prevents cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers.
