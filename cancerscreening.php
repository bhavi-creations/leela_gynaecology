      <h2>Cancer Screening</h2>
      <p>
      Cancer screening is a crucial preventive measure in gynecology, aiming to detect cancers like cervical, ovarian, uterine, and breast cancer at an early, more treatable stage. Regular screenings, such as Pap smears, HPV testing, mammograms, pelvic exams, and ultrasounds, help identify abnormal cell changes before they develop into cancer.


      </p>
      <p>
      Early detection increases treatment success rates, reduces mortality, and improves overall health outcomes. Women are encouraged to follow recommended screening schedules based on their age, medical history, and risk factors. Advanced diagnostic techniques, including colposcopy, biopsy, and genetic testing, further aid in precise detection and personalized treatment planning.
