      <h2>Ultrasound Scanning</h2>
      <p>
      Ultrasound scanning is a safe and non-invasive imaging technique used in gynecology and obstetrics to monitor pregnancy, diagnose reproductive health issues, and assess fetal development. It utilizes high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of the uterus, ovaries, and fetus, helping detect abnormalities, confirm gestational age, and guide medical procedures.


      </p>
      <p>
      In pregnancy, ultrasound plays a crucial role in tracking fetal growth, identifying complications, and ensuring maternal and babyâ€™s well-being. Its accuracy and safety make it an essential tool in modern gynecological and prenatal care.
