              <p>
              Menopause is a natural biological process marking the end of a woman's reproductive years.
               It is diagnosed after 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period, usually occurring 
               between the ages of 45 and 55. Stages of Menopause
Perimenopause (Transition Phase)
Starts several years before menopause as hormone levels (especially estrogen) begin to fluctuate.
Irregular periods, hot flashes, and mood swings may occur.
 Menopause (Official Onset)
Defined as 12 months without a menstrual cycle.
Symptoms may include vaginal dryness, night sweats, and sleep disturbances.
 Postmenopause (After Menopause)
Symptoms may persist, but risks of osteoporosis and heart disease increase due to lower estrogen levels.
