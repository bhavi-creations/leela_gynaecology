      <h2>Lactational Consultation</h2>
      <p>
      Lactational consultation is a specialized service that supports new mothers in establishing and maintaining successful breastfeeding. Certified lactation consultants provide expert advice on proper latching techniques, breastfeeding positions, milk supply management, and overcoming common challenges such as nipple pain, engorgement, or low milk production.

      <p>
      Breastfeeding is crucial for a babyâ€™s nutrition, immunity, and overall health, but many mothers face difficulties in the initial stages. A lactation consultant helps address these concerns by offering personalized guidance, ensuring both mother and baby have a comfortable and effective feeding experience.
