      <h2>Menstrual Problems</h2>

      <p>Menstrual problems are common among women of all ages and can include irregular periods, heavy bleeding (menorrhagia), painful cramps (dysmenorrhea), missed periods (amenorrhea), and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These issues can be caused by hormonal imbalances, stress, lifestyle factors, underlying medical conditions, or reproductive disorders such as PCOD or endometriosis.

</p>
<p>
Proper diagnosis and timely treatment are essential to prevent complications like anemia, infertility, and severe pelvic pain. Management options include lifestyle modifications, medications, hormonal therapy, and, in some cases, medical procedures. Seeking medical advice can help women maintain a healthy menstrual cycle and overall well-being.
