      <h2>PCOD and Adolscent Clinics</h2>
      <p>Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) is a common hormonal disorder affecting young girls and women of reproductive age. It can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, excessive hair growth, acne, weight gain, and fertility issues. Early diagnosis and management are essential to prevent long-term complications such as diabetes, heart disease, and hormonal imbalances.
      </p>

      <p>
      Adolescent clinics provide specialized care for young girls experiencing menstrual irregularities, hormonal imbalances, and other reproductive health concerns. These clinics focus on early intervention, lifestyle modifications, hormonal therapy, and emotional well-being to help young women achieve a healthier reproductive system. Education and counseling play a crucial role in empowering adolescents to understand their bodies and make informed health choices.
