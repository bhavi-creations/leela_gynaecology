            <h2>PCOD and Adolscent Clinics</h2>
            <p>Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) is a common hormonal disorder affecting females, including adolescents, and is characterized by multiple small cysts in the ovaries. It disrupts hormonal balance, leading to various symptoms that can impact physical and emotional well-being.
                 Excess production of androgens (male hormones) leads to irregular menstrual cycles.
 The bodyâ€™s inability to use insulin efficiently can contribute to high insulin levels, triggering PCOD symptoms.
 A family history of PCOD increases the likelihood of developing it.
 Poor diet, lack of exercise, and stress may exacerbate the condition.
