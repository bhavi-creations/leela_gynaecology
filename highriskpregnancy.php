      <h2>High Risk Pregnancy</h2>
      <p>
      A high-risk pregnancy refers to a condition where the mother, baby, or both face an increased risk of complications before, during, or after childbirth. It can be caused by pre-existing health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease, as well as pregnancy-related issues such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, multiple pregnancies, or fetal abnormalities.

      </p>
      <p>
      Specialized medical care, frequent monitoring, and advanced diagnostic tests help manage risks and ensure a safe delivery. With timely interventions, lifestyle modifications, and expert guidance, high-risk pregnancies can be effectively managed to achieve the best possible outcomes for both mother and baby.
