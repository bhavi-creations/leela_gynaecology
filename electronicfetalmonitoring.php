      <h2>Electronic Fetal Monitoring</h2>
      <p>
      Electronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) is a vital technique used during pregnancy and labor to track the baby’s heart rate and uterine contractions. It helps assess fetal well-being, detect distress, and ensure timely medical interventions if needed.


      </p>



      <p>
      There are two types of EFM: external monitoring, which uses sensors on the mother’s abdomen, and internal monitoring, which provides more precise readings using an electrode placed on the baby’s scalp. EFM plays a crucial role in high-risk pregnancies and labor management, ensuring a safe delivery for both mother and baby.
