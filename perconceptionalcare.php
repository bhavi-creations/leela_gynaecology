            <h2>Preconceptional Care</h2>
            <p>
            Preconceptional care focuses on preparing a womanâ€™s body for a healthy pregnancy by addressing medical, nutritional, and lifestyle factors before conception. It involves assessing overall health, managing existing medical conditions, ensuring optimal nutrition with folic acid and essential vitamins, and identifying potential risk factors that could affect pregnancy outcomes.

            </p>
            <p>
            Gynecologists provide guidance on reproductive health, lifestyle modifications, vaccination updates, and genetic counseling to minimize complications during pregnancy. By optimizing maternal health before conception, preconceptional care enhances fertility, reduces pregnancy risks, and promotes better outcomes for both mother and baby.
